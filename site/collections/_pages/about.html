      <p>
        I’m a software developer in the Louisville, KY area.
        I am an <a href="https://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> member, an <a href="https://xfce.org">Xfce</a> contributor, and
        the <a href="https://xubuntu.org">Xubuntu</a> Technical Lead.
        The applications I develop are powered by C, Python, Vala, and GTK to be lightweight, fast, and efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        I received my degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.berea.edu">Berea College</a>.
        Since then, I worked in QA for a couple of years before finding my calling in web and app development.
        I’m now working as a Software Development Manager in Louisville, KY.

        I develop lightweight, powerful, and accessible tools to make your computer and life easier. My projects run well on
        older hardware, reducing E-waste and providing opportunities by keeping computers running longer.<br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        By supporting <a class="normal-link" href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs), I hope to have some positive
        impact on the world.
